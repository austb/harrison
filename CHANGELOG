-------------------
- BREAKING: Definition of "deploy" task has significantly changed. Deploys
  are now comprised of 1 or more phases and each phase must complete
  successfully on all hosts before proceeding to the next phase. If an
  error is encountered, Harrison will attempt to unwind any changes made
  by previously completed phases by invoking the code block supplied to
  each phase's "on_fail" method. There are several built-in phases to
  perform common deployment related tasks. See the README for more
  information.

- BREAKING: Commands executed with remote_exec() inside the "run" block of
  the "package" task will now execute in your commit working directory, so
  you no longer need to prefix commands with "cd #{h.commit}". You will
  need to update existing Harrisonfile "package" run blocks to reflect the
  change of execution context.

- Allow multiple users to execute the "package" task for the same project
  simultaneously.

- Added "rollback" command which will create a new deploy pointing to the
  previously active release.
