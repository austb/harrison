-------------------
- BREAKING: Commands executed with remote_exec() inside the "run" block of
  the "package" task will now execute in your commit working directory, so
  you no longer need to prefix commands with "cd #{h.commit}". You will
  need to update existing Harrisonfile "package" run blocks to reflect the
  change of execution context.

- Allow multiple users to execute the "package" task for the same project
  simultaneously.

- Added "rollback" command which will create a new deploy pointing to the
  previously active release.
