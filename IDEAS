Ideas:
------
[ ] Allow more elaborate hosts config, e.g.: h.hosts = [ { host: '10.16.18.207', tags: %w(util migrate) } ]
[ ] Some kind of --dry-run option.
[ ] Allow deploy_via to include alternate user/connection options.
[ ] Rename "releases" => "builds" (and "deploys" => "releases"?)
[ ] Upload artifact to all hosts before the rest of the deployment process begins.
[ ] --force option for deploy task to overwrite an existing release
[ ] Something like a "status" command that shows what commit is live for env (on each host?)
[ ] Move artifacts out of pkg/ (and into like pkg/deployed) once they have been deployed? (Some sort of flag for the significant env?)
[ ] Include branch name in artifact file name.
[ ] Make --purge the default behavior for the package step.
