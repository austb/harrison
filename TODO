Bugs:
-----
[ ] Test that artifact exists before doing anything for deploy task.

In Progress:
------------
[ ] Unit Testing

Definitely:
-----------
[ ] Rollback action.
[ ] Error handling (with automatic rollback/undo)
[ ] Further de-compose actions so that specific parts can be easily overridden.
[ ] When deploying via a proxy, cache artifact on proxy before deploying to hosts.
[ ] Banner text in --help output.
[ ] Improve unit testing, try to minimize coupling to implementation details.
[ ] Include branch name in artifact file name.

Maybe:
------
[ ] Allow more elaborate hosts config, e.g.: h.hosts = [ { host: '10.16.18.207', tags: %w(util migrate) } ]
[ ] Some kind of --dry-run option.
[ ] Allow deploy_via to include alternate user/connection options.
[ ] Rename "releases" => "builds" (and "deploys" => "releases"?)
[ ] Upload artifact to all hosts before the rest of the deployment process begins.
[ ] --force option for deploy task to overwrite an existing release
