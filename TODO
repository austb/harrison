In Progress:
------------
[ ] Unit Testing

Definitely:
-----------
[ ] Rollback action.
[ ] Error handling (with automatic rollback)
[ ] Further de-compose actions so that specific parts can be easily overridden.
[ ] When deploying via a proxy, cache artifact on proxy before deploying to hosts.
[ ] Banner text in --help output.

Maybe:
------
[ ] Allow more elaborate hosts config, e.g.: h.hosts = [ { host: '10.16.18.207', tags: %w(util migrate) } ]
